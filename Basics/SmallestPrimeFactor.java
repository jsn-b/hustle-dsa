/**
 * Just like sieve of eratosthenes example. The only difference is that rather than marking a number as
 * prime or not, we mark a number by its least or smallest prime factor.
 * incase the number is equal to the prime factor, then it is a prime factor
 * 
 * the index is treated as a number and the number in the array is treated as the smallest prime factor
 * of the number.
 * 
 * this way we can find the smallest prime factor of a given number.
